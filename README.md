🐾 #Astro AI — Dog-Themed Chatbot Powered by OpenRouter
Astro AI is a playful and responsive chatbot web app featuring a friendly dog assistant that responds using AI-generated messages via OpenRouter. Built with HTML, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, and Vite.

##🚀 Features
- Clean and responsive UI
- TailwindCSS styling with gradient and icon support
- Fun dog-themed personality
- Real-time streaming responses from OpenRouter
- Simple and easy-to-extend JavaScript codebase

##⚙️ Technologies Used
- HTML5
- TailwindCSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- OpenRouter AI SDK (@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider)
- Vite (for local development)

##🧠 How It Works
1. User types a prompt into the search field and submits.
2. The app sends the input to OpenRouter using the AI SDK.
3. The response is streamed back or fetched as a complete message.
4. The result is rendered in the page's main container.

##📦 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/astro-ai.git
cd astro-ai
npm install
```

##🔑 Setup

```env
VITE_OPENROUTER_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash

```
